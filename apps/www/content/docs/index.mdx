## Overview

mdx-ui is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable MDX components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Following the shadcn/ui philosophy of copy & paste components rather than installing as dependencies.

## Features

- **13 Production-Ready Components** - From blockquotes to interactive tabs
- **Fully Customizable** - Built with Tailwind CSS for easy styling
- **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety out of the box
- **Dark Mode Ready** - All components support dark mode
- **Accessible** - Built with accessibility in mind
- **CLI Tool** - Easy installation with automatic dependency resolution

## Quick Start

Get started by installing the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g mdx-ui
```

Then add components to your project:

```bash
npx mdx-ui add blockquote callout
```

The CLI will automatically:
- Copy component files to your project
- Install required npm dependencies
- Resolve registry dependencies (like the `utils` helper)

## Philosophy

This project follows the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) approach:

- **Copy & Paste** - Components are added to your project, not installed as dependencies
- **Own Your Code** - Modify components however you need
- **Composable** - Build complex UIs by combining simple components
- **Accessible** - Components follow accessibility best practices
