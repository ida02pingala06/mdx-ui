npx @suryaravikumar/mdx-ui add horizontal-rule

```

All three syntaxes render the same horizontal rule.

## Features

- Responsive spacing
- Theme-aware styling
- Semantic HTML (`<hr>`)

## Examples

### Section Divider

```mdx
## First Section

Content for the first section.

---

## Second Section

Content for the second section.
```

### Between Content

```mdx
Here's some important information.

---

And here's some more context below.
```

### Multiple Rules

```mdx
# Document Title

Introduction text.

---

## Main Content

The main content goes here.

---

## Conclusion

Final thoughts and summary.
```

## Styling

The horizontal rule has default spacing and styling that works well in most contexts. It uses theme colors and adapts to light/dark modes.

## Customization

You can customize the horizontal rule through your MDX component mappings:

```tsx
import { Hr } from "@/components/mdx-ui/horizontal-rule"

export const mdxComponents = {
  hr: Hr,
}
```

## Accessibility

- Uses semantic `<hr>` element
- Properly announces section breaks to screen readers
- Maintains visual rhythm with appropriate spacing
