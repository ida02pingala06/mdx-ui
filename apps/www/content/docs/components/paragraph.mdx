import { Paragraph, Lead, Intro, Large, Small, Muted } from "@/components/mdx/paragraph"

## Installation

```bash
npx mdx-ui add paragraph
```

## Usage

The Paragraph component provides a flexible way to create text paragraphs with different styles and alignments. It uses `class-variance-authority` for variant management.

### Default Paragraph

<div className="preview">
  <Paragraph>
    This is a default paragraph with standard text sizing and spacing. It provides good readability
    for body content with proper line height and margins.
  </Paragraph>
</div>

```tsx
<Paragraph>
  This is a default paragraph with standard text sizing and spacing.
</Paragraph>
```

## Variants

### Lead Paragraph

Use lead paragraphs to create emphasis at the beginning of an article or section.

<div className="preview">
  <Lead>
    This is a lead paragraph that draws attention with larger text and muted color.
    Perfect for introductions and opening statements.
  </Lead>
</div>

```tsx
<Lead>
  This is a lead paragraph that draws attention with larger text.
</Lead>
```

### Intro Paragraph

Similar to lead but with slightly different styling for introductory content.

<div className="preview">
  <Intro>
    This is an intro paragraph designed for section introductions. It has comfortable
    spacing and slightly larger text for improved readability.
  </Intro>
</div>

```tsx
<Intro>
  This is an intro paragraph designed for section introductions.
</Intro>
```

### Large Paragraph

For emphasized text that needs more prominence.

<div className="preview">
  <Large>
    This is a large paragraph with bold text for important statements.
  </Large>
</div>

```tsx
<Large>
  This is a large paragraph with bold text for important statements.
</Large>
```

### Small Paragraph

For fine print, captions, or supplementary information.

<div className="preview">
  <Small>
    This is a small paragraph for captions, fine print, or secondary information.
  </Small>
</div>

```tsx
<Small>
  This is a small paragraph for captions or fine print.
</Small>
```

### Muted Paragraph

For de-emphasized text or supplementary content.

<div className="preview">
  <Muted>
    This is a muted paragraph with reduced visual emphasis. Great for secondary
    information that supports the main content.
  </Muted>
</div>

```tsx
<Muted>
  This is a muted paragraph with reduced visual emphasis.
</Muted>
```

## Alignment

Control text alignment with the `align` prop.

<div className="preview">
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <Paragraph align="left">
      This paragraph is aligned to the left (default alignment).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph align="center">
      This paragraph is centered.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph align="right">
      This paragraph is aligned to the right.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph align="justify">
      This paragraph is justified, meaning the text is spread out to align with both left and right margins. This creates a clean, uniform edge on both sides.
    </Paragraph>
  </div>
</div>

```tsx
<Paragraph align="left">Left aligned (default)</Paragraph>
<Paragraph align="center">Center aligned</Paragraph>
<Paragraph align="right">Right aligned</Paragraph>
<Paragraph align="justify">Justified text</Paragraph>
```

## Custom Styling

Combine variants with custom classes for unique styles.

<div className="preview">
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <Paragraph className="text-blue-600">
      Custom blue paragraph
    </Paragraph>
    <Lead className="italic">
      Italic lead paragraph
    </Lead>
    <Paragraph variant="muted" className="border-l-4 border-muted-foreground pl-4">
      Paragraph with custom border
    </Paragraph>
  </div>
</div>

```tsx
<Paragraph className="text-blue-600">
  Custom blue paragraph
</Paragraph>

<Lead className="italic">
  Italic lead paragraph
</Lead>

<Paragraph variant="muted" className="border-l-4 pl-4">
  Paragraph with custom border
</Paragraph>
```

## Using Different Elements

Change the HTML element while maintaining paragraph styling.

<div className="preview">
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <Paragraph as="p">Rendered as &lt;p&gt; tag (default)</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph as="div">Rendered as &lt;div&gt; tag</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph as="span">Rendered as &lt;span&gt; tag</Paragraph>
  </div>
</div>

```tsx
<Paragraph as="p">Rendered as p tag (default)</Paragraph>
<Paragraph as="div">Rendered as div tag</Paragraph>
<Paragraph as="span">Rendered as span tag</Paragraph>
```

## Combining Variants

Mix and match variants and alignment for custom combinations.

<div className="preview">
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <Paragraph variant="lead" align="center">
      Centered lead paragraph
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph variant="large" align="right">
      Right-aligned large text
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph variant="intro" align="justify">
      This is a justified intro paragraph that demonstrates how variants can be combined with alignment options to create exactly the style you need.
    </Paragraph>
  </div>
</div>

```tsx
<Paragraph variant="lead" align="center">
  Centered lead paragraph
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph variant="large" align="right">
  Right-aligned large text
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph variant="intro" align="justify">
  Justified intro paragraph
</Paragraph>
```

## Props

### Paragraph

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `variant` | `"default" \| "lead" \| "intro" \| "large" \| "small" \| "muted"` | `"default"` | The paragraph style variant |
| `align` | `"left" \| "center" \| "right" \| "justify"` | `"left"` | Text alignment |
| `as` | `"p" \| "div" \| "span"` | `"p"` | The HTML element to render |
| `className` | `string` | - | Additional CSS classes |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | - | Paragraph content |

All standard HTML paragraph attributes are also supported.

### Convenience Components

These components are pre-configured versions of `Paragraph` with specific variants:

- **Lead**: `variant="lead"`
- **Intro**: `variant="intro"`
- **Large**: `variant="large"`
- **Small**: `variant="small"`
- **Muted**: `variant="muted"`

All convenience components accept the same props as `Paragraph` except `variant`.

## Best Practices

### Use Semantic HTML
```tsx
// ✅ Good - semantic HTML
<Paragraph>Body text</Paragraph>

// ❌ Avoid - unless you need non-semantic element
<Paragraph as="div">Body text</Paragraph>
```

### Consistent Spacing
```tsx
// ✅ Good - let the component handle spacing
<Paragraph>First paragraph</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Second paragraph</Paragraph>

// ❌ Avoid - manual spacing
<Paragraph className="mb-6">First paragraph</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Second paragraph</Paragraph>
```

### Clear Hierarchy
```tsx
// ✅ Good - clear visual hierarchy
<Lead>Important introduction</Lead>
<Paragraph>Supporting details</Paragraph>
<Muted>Additional context</Muted>

// ❌ Confusing - mixed hierarchy
<Small>Important introduction</Small>
<Large>Additional context</Large>
```

## Accessibility

- Use appropriate HTML elements (`<p>` for paragraphs)
- Maintain good contrast ratios for muted variants
- Ensure text alignment doesn't harm readability (avoid full justification for narrow columns)
- Keep line length comfortable (45-75 characters for optimal readability)

## Playground

Try different combinations of variants, alignments, and custom styles to see what works for your content.
